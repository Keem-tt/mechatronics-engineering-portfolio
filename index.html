        <h2>Problem &amp; Objective</h2>
        <p>
          In busy classrooms and collaboration spaces, thoroughly erasing large whiteboards can take up to two minutes. Over a week this lost time adds up to nearly an hour, disrupting instruction and reducing productivity. Instructors often rush the task, leaving ghosted markings that degrade surface quality and readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>OTO</strong> was designed to solve this by automating the erase process. The goal is a portable device that traverses the board, wipes consistently and quietly, is simple to use, and costs under <em>$150</em> including expansion.

        <h2>Overview &amp; Features</h2>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Low cost</h3>
            <p>The prototype BOM is about <strong>$136.87</strong>, with modular expansion costing roughly <strong>$3.73 per additional 0.5&nbsp;ft</strong> of travel.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Modular &amp; Scalable</h3>
            <p>The base prototype covers a <strong>1.5 ft × 0.5 ft</strong> area; the rack‑and‑pinion rail can be extended to boards up to 8 ft wide by adding printed segments.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Simple Interface</h3>
            <p>A single push‑button starts a cleaning cycle. Built‑in calibration logic homes to dual limit switches and executes <strong>10 sweeps per cycle</strong>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Quiet &amp; Efficient</h3>
            <p>Powered by a NEMA 17 stepper with a TMC2209 driver for silent microstepping and current control, OTO operates at less than <strong>60 dB(A)</strong> while producing 2–4 N of eraser force.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Long Runtime</h3>
            <p>An 11.1 V 2200 mAh Li‑ion battery powers over <strong>30 cleaning cycles</strong> on a single charge. A DC‑DC boost converter supplies 20 V for the motor while isolating logic.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Open &amp; Repairable</h3>
            <p>All parts are designed in Fusion 360 and 3D‑printed in PLA+. The full CAD, code and report are open‑source so educators and makers can reproduce and iterate on the design.</p>

        <h2>Design Iteration</h2>
        <p>
          OTO underwent multiple iterations before reaching the current release:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visual ideation:</strong> Early CAD focused on motion feasibility but lacked modularity.</li>
          <li><strong>Beta build:</strong> Introduced 0.5 ft rack segments and snap‑fit joints; validated modular rail concept.</li>
          <li><strong>Alpha build:</strong> Added power and communication bin and integrated carriage; highlighted issues with weight distribution and eraser glide.</li>
          <li><strong>Release candidate:</strong> Redesigned racks into three‑part plates, added adjustable Velcro‑mounted pads and optimized cable management.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="section fade-in" id="manufacturing">
        <h2>Manufacturing &amp; Materials</h2>
        <p>
          All mechanical parts are fabricated via Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) using grey PLA+ on an Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro. Prints use 0.2 mm layers, 3 walls, 4 top/bottom layers, 20% grid infill and 50 mm/s speed. Long components are divided into ≤0.5 ft sections and snap‑fit joints are tolerance‑tested in 0.1 mm increments for easy assembly.

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>
          By automating a mundane yet necessary task, OTO returns nearly an hour of instructional time each week per classroom. Consistent erasing extends board life and improves legibility. With a total cost under <strong>$150</strong>, OTO is accessible to underserved schools and DIY makers. The open‑source design encourages learning and community improvements.
